This is my another project I created in University as a student for TVET using ReactJS. This is a simple front end website for schhol info system like admin account or so inspired

By using ReactJS, I used npm create vite@latest. By using vite only. Not npx or so
Please download NodeJS to be able to work this properly if necessary

Project name and all then the framework to select React. Then stick to JavaScript. Follow the instructions if needed somehow.
For npm install for this project, use this following below what i used for ReactJS(can use and change if needed somehow): 

npm install react-router-dom styled-components @emotion/react @emotion/styled
npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled
npm install @mui/icons-material

npm install react-datepicker
npm install primereact primeicons
npm install recharts
npm install react-chartjs-2 chart.js

npm install bootstrap
npm install react-bootstrap
npm install react-bootstrap bootstrap(alternative)

npm install formik
npm install yup

This is my npm install for this work. Used it since it'll appear from it and all

You can use this as a Schol Information/Management System and can change to for the backend and full stack if needed. I make this simple front end website so that you don't have to worry about doing full stack or so.

Use this link on the website to the video on Youtube to find the resolve error if any issues somehow:
